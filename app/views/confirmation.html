      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Next steps</h2>
      <p>Your building is now registered. The registration details will be stored in the 'My registered buildings' section of your <a href="#">Building Safety Regulator portal</a>.</p>
      <p>It is important to note that accountable persons are required to update the information submitted where it changes. This includes where a high-rise building will no longer be in scope and should be removed from the register, which may be temporary or permanent.</p>
      <p>In due course the Building Registration team will invite you to apply for or renew your Building Assessment Certificate. To get prepared for this, find out what's required in our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/user-centred-design/resources/patterns/feedback-pages.html">Building Assessment Certification guidance.</a></p>
